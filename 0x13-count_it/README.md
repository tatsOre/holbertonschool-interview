# 0x13. Count it!

Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

* Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
* Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. `java java java` counts as 3 separate occurrences of `java`.
* NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.
